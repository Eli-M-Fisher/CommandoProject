# Commando Project

This is a simple C# project for learning and practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## What it includes

- A `Commando` class with tools, status, and actions like walk, hide, and attack.
- `Weapon` class that can shoot bullets.
- Special commando types:
  - `AirCommando` – can parachute and attack differently.
  - `SeaCommando` – can swim and attack differently.
- Demonstration of:
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism

## How to run

Make sure you have .NET installed. Then open the terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Purpose

This project is for learning. It helps understand the basics of OOP step by step.

# Commando Project

A simple C# console project to learn and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SOLID principles.

## Key Features

- `Commando` class with name, code name, tools and actions (walk, hide, attack)
- Special types:
  - `AirCommando`: can parachute and attack from air
  - `SeaCommando`: can swim and attack from sea
- `Weapon` class: can shoot bullets
- Breakable objects: `Stone`, `Knife` (using interfaces)
- Enemies with name, health and shout behavior
- Central `Game` class that runs all demos step by step

## Principles Used

- OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- SOLID: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Interface Segregation

## How to Run

Make sure .NET is installed. Then run:

```bash
dotnet run
```

All output is shown in the console.
